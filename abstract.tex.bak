Hadoop is a widely used computing framework and Docker is a popular container technology that emerged last year and then quickly adopted by a lot of commercial companies. This paper examines the combination of Hadoop with Docker container, explores how Docker container works in Hadoop, and analyzes the security issues solved by adopting Docker container and the security issues not solved or introduced by Docker container.

Our analysis shows that YARN NodeManager executes Docker command to launch multiple Docker containers in order to perform Hadoop MapReduce jobs. This method on one hand provides isolated MapReduce Job runtime environment, protecting secrecy and integrity of the executed programs to a large extent. This is due to the reason that the containers limit the damages caused by arbitrary code execution during MapReduce job execution time, and prevents attackers on the compromised node from adding errors into job computations. It is also because that the launched containers will be killed after it finishes the assigned tasks. On the other hand, Docker container could not protect data integrity and secrecy of HDFS. This is because Docker container requires Hadoop to run in the non-secure mode, disabling user authorization and credentials. Docker container also introduces other security risks, namely the problem of setuid. The permission of Docker has to be changed to enable launching Docker containers.
