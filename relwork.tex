Hatman~\cite{khan2012hatman} is the first full-scale, data-centric, reputation-based trust management system for Hadoop clouds. Hatman dynamically assesses node integrity by comparing job replica outputs for consistency.

Data and computation integrity and security are major concerns for users of cloud computing facilities. Many production-level clouds optimistically assume that all cloud nodes are equally trustworthy when dispatching jobs; jobs are dispatched based on node load, not reputation. This increases their vulnerability to attack, since compromising even one node suffices to corrupt the integrity of many distributed computations.




With the growing use of Hadoop to tackle big data analytics involving sensitive data, a Hadoop cluster could be a target for data exfiltration~\cite{cohen2012incorporating},

long persistent attack: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)

By implementing open standards based Trusted Computing technology at the infrastructure and application levels; a novel and robust security posture and protection is presented. 



SecureMR~\cite{wei2009securemr}, a practical service integrity assurance framework for MapReduce. SecureMR consists of five security components, which provide a set of practical security mechanisms that not only ensure MapReduce service integrity as well as to prevent replay and denial of service (DoS) attacks, but also preserve the simplicity, applicability and scalability of MapReduce.



MapReduce suffers from the integrity assurance vulnerability: it takes merely one malicious worker to render the overall computation result useless. Existing solutions are effective in defeating the malicious behavior of non-collusive workers, but are futile in detecting collusive workers.

The basic idea of VIAF~\cite{wang2011viaf} is to combine task replication with non-deterministic verification, in which consistent but malicious results from collusive mappers can be detected by a trusted verifier.
